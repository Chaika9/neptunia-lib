# NeptuniaLib

NeptuniaLib is my personal library for Epitech projects. It contains a lot of useful functions and macros that I use in my projects.

The library is divided into several parts:
- **neptunia**: Contains similar functions to the standard library (like `strlen`, `strdup`, `strchr`, etc.). You are also a library for creating and manipulating linked lists (my own implementation).
- **hyper-neptunia**: Contains custom functions that I use in my projects. You will find functions to manipulate strings, xml, etc.
